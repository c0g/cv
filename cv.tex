\section{Experience}
\begin{entrylist}
  \entry
    {2014}
    {Google Impact Challenge Winner}
    {University of Oxford with Kew Gardens}
    {In partnership with Kew Gardens, the Machine Learning Research Group (MLRG) of the University of Oxford applied for a Google Impact Grant to track the distribution of species of mosquitos. Our group's responsibility is signal processing and inference, with the aim of inferring the species of a mosquito from its sound. I performed the initial investigation of this premise and helped to write both the proposal and the work plan.}
  \entry
    {Since 2012}
    {Director and Developer}
    {Animal health spinout from the University of Oxford}
    {I ported our science platform to Android smartphones and visit our partners both in the UK and internationally. Along with the other directors, I am responsible for the future direction of the company.}

\section{Education}
\begin{entrylist}
  \entry
    {Since 2012}
    {DPhil {\normalfont candidate in Machine Learning}}
    {MLRG, University of Oxford}
    {Funded by the \href{http://www.orchid.ac.uk/}{ORCHID Project}. I am working on machine learning on low power devices and in javascript, efficient Bayesian optimisation and methods to present uncertain data to humans. The majority of my work involves using Gaussian processes to express uncertainty over the state of the world and coming up with an optimal action given this uncertainty. My platform for this is the Jetson TK1, a low power CUDA board. I expect to finish around \boldfont\addfontfeature{Color=gray} September 2016.}
  \entry
    {2008â€“2012}
    {MEng, {\normalfont First Class Honours}}
    {University of Oxford}
    {Specialised in Information and Electronic Engineering. I did my fourth   year project on eye tracking using electrooculography.}

\section{Other Experience}
\begin{entrylist}
    \entry
{November 2014}{Signal Processing TA}{AIMS CDT, University of Oxford}
{I assisted development of the coursework. During the week long lab session I helped and directed the students. My section of the course concentrated on the application of Kalman filters to streaming inference, beginning with the standard object tracking activity and continuing to estimating the coefficients of an autoregressive model.}
